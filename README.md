### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on adding more features to my main project which is the **[ProjectView app](https://github.com/stachusmith/mysite-ProjectView)**.

In addition to that, I'm also working on my new Spotify app (also within the **[ProjectView app](https://github.com/stachusmith/mysite-ProjectView)** repository:

- anyone who's ever used the Spotify shuffle function, knows that it sucks
- this app will download your playlist, randomize it and upload it back again as a new one
- I will be using the Django REST Framework to communicate with Spotify's API
